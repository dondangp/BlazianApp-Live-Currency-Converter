Android Currency Converter
1. The app is a simple currency converter, allowing users to convert up to 160+ currencies
in the world.
2. If allowed, the user can provide their location and the app will search for nearby banks.
Selecting a bank will provide the user with the bank’s name and address.
3. The app includes an inflation calculator, so the user can find out how much dollar value
in a specific year will be in another year.
4. The app will also provide a visualization of the change in value for the currency, starting
from the selected year to another year.
5. Users are able to manually store transaction exchanges, which includes the time of
transaction, currency swapped, rates, and fees. The application will ask the user for a PIN
security code, as transaction exchange information may be sensitive.
6. If it’s a new user, they will provide a new pin code with a security question & answer, in
case the pin was forgotten.
7. Allow the user to reset their pin-code by answering their provided security question.
